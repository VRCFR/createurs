This script is currently not present in the Udon example scene.

:::

This UdonBehaviour example script allows you configure player voices and avatar audio in your VRChat world.

This script sets these values once when a player joins your world. You may use other scripts to change these values later.

For more information, please read the [Player Audio](/worlds/udon/players/player-audio/) documentation.
